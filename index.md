Hello, my name is Pokkrit Jeerapat, and I am passionate about engineering design, problem-solving, and building ideas into real products. I am currently pursuing studies in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, where I focus on mechanical systems, structural analysis, product development, and hands-on fabrication. I enjoy combining analytical thinking with creativity—whether through designing mechanical mechanisms, developing business concepts, or working on real-world engineering projects. This portfolio showcases my academic work, engineering projects, and professional experiences. I hope it gives you a clear picture of my skills, values, and ambitions as I continue growing toward a career where technology, innovation, and practical execution meet.
