In this project, we develop a simplified dynamic model of a sailboat to understand how its motion responds to wind forces, hydrodynamic effects, and control inputs. The goal is to translate the physical behavior of the boat into a tractable system of equations that can be analyzed using classical system dynamics tools. By identifying the dominant forces acting on the hull and sail, defining appropriate state variables, and applying Newton’s laws, we construct a mathematical representation that captures the boat’s key longitudinal and lateral dynamics.

The resulting model allows us to study how the sailboat reaches steady-state (trim) conditions, how external disturbances influence its motion, and how parameter changes affect stability and performance. Although simplified, this framework provides clear insight into the fundamental physics governing sailboat behavior and establishes a foundation for more advanced simulations and control strategies.
