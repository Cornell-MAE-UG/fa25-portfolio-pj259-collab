The objective of this project is to analyze and understand the fluid-mechanic principles embedded in a common household coffee-making machine. Although the device is simple from a user standpoint, its internal operation relies on several fundamental fluid dynamics concepts that govern how water is transported, heated, and discharged. In particular, this project focuses on dissecting the machine to study the air-lift pump mechanism, the flow characteristics within the tubing system, and how different internal components influence flow behavior.

The coffee machine contains a heating chamber that produces vapor bubbles, which drive an air-lift pumping effect that forces water upward through narrow channels. This operation provides a practical demonstration of multiphase flow, pressure-driven motion, and buoyancy-induced pumping without the use of traditional mechanical pumps. Additionally, the internal tubing creates varying flow regimes, allowing us to assess when laminar flow conditions occur based on Reynolds number estimation and tube geometry. By inspecting flow passages, valves, and flow-restricting features, we relate physical layout to observed flow rates and pressure changes.

By combining mechanical dissection with fluid-mechanic analysis, this project reveals how a standard consumer appliance uses basic engineering principles—such as laminar flow, hydrostatic pressure differences, and air-induced pumping—to reliably deliver water through the system. The findings highlight how theoretical fluid-mechanics concepts translate directly into an everyday device, offering insight into design trade-offs, simplicity of operation, and the effectiveness of non-mechanical pumping strategies.
