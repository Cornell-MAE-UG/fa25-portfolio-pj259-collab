This project focuses on the design and analysis of a torque wrench for MAE3270. A CAD model of the wrench was created to represent its geometry and loading conditions realistically. Using ANSYS finite element analysis, the wrench was evaluated under an applied torque to determine key performance characteristics, including stress distribution, strain levels, and tip deflection. These results allow us to assess whether the wrench can withstand the required loading without failure and whether the measured deformation is within an acceptable range for functionality. Overall, this study applies engineering design principles and computational tools to validate the structural performance of a mechanical tool used in real-world applications.
